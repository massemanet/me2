When people say they've designed a language, I go; me too!

properties
-----

  A statically typed language for the Erlang VM (`beam`). Sports (or rather, might
some day) a Hindley-Milner row-polymorphic type system, abstract patterns, typed
simplex process communication, math with rationals and infinitesimals (using the
Levi-Civita field). Compiles to a statically linked ELF binary.
  
status
-----

Unfinished; now and, in all likelihood, forever. It's a vehicle for me to learn
things.
